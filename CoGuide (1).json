        "text": ": Create a discussion launch for Benjamin Franklin's 13 virtues\nHTML: Rules of Engagement: What shall we focus on to have a meaningful conversation? \n\nIntroduction: At Acton, we focus on different types of learning: learning to do, learning to be, learning to know, learning to learn… The journey is about so much more than just remembering and regurgitating information, it’s about doing meaningful and engaging things and transforming who you are, your “being,” your character. \n\nWhen you think about all the actions you take throughout the day, waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, talking, exercising, meditating, playing, working, learning, collaborating, focusing, etc. how much of your day goes into building your character? A lot or a little? (Can ask them to rate it on a scale of 1-5 as well, and ask to clarify their ratings.)\n\nToday, we look at one of the most influential figures to help shape our country, a founding father, who was also an inventor, a diplomat, and so much more, and how he worked on his own character.\n\n\n[Show:  https://youtu.be/LhbMH_t29BM?feature=shared]\n\nQuestion 1\nImagine you are Ben Franklin and you are about to start this program you’ve created for yourself. Which of  the 13 virtues would you start with? Why? \nDo you start off with an easier one to gain momentum or do you start off with a harder one, to set the stage? \n\nQuestion 2\nIf Ben Franklin came to observe your studio for an entire week, what virtues would he see in action, here in the studio? Why? \nOf the 13 virtues, what would he say our studio needs to work harder on? Why?  more improvement? \n\n\nQuestion 3\nOne way that all of you work on developing virtues and building character is by focusing on Learning To Be and Servant Leader Badges. (You can pull up a chart of servant leader badges for the studio, or the learning to be section of the Journey Conference Checklist as a visual.)\nWhy would someone want to make their own life more challenging and difficult by setting, tracking, and working on virtues and character? Why do you set these? \nWould a notebook and chart like Ben Franklin’s help you track these better or do you have a better system? \n\nCall to Action: How will you work on Personal Growth today? Which virtue will you try to develop? Who will notice? Why does it matter? 1-2-Break.\n\n: Create Current Event Launch about James Madison Middle School\nHTML: ```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Current Event Launch</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            margin: 20px;\n            padding: 20px;\n            background-color: #f7f7f7;\n        }\n        h1, h2, h3 {\n            color: #333;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            font-size: 2.5em;\n            margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n        }\n        h2 {\n            font-size: 2em;\n            margin-top: 1.5em;\n            margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n        }\n        h3 {\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n            margin-top: 1em;\n            margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n        }\n        p {\n            margin-bottom: 1em;\n        }\n        .section {\n            background-color: #fff;\n            padding: 15px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n        }\n        .rules-of-engagement {\n            color: red;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n        .rules-of-engagement p{\n            color: red;\n        }\n        .video-container {\n            position: relative;\n            padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */\n            height: 0;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n        .video-container iframe {\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n        }\n        .call-to-action {\n            font-weight: bold;\n            color: #0077cc;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <div class=\"rules-of-engagement\">\n            <h1>Rules of Engagement</h1>\n            <p>What shall we focus on to have a meaningful conversation?</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>Introduction/Context</h2>\n        <p>James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, is often hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
